# Context

Genshin Impact is a video game with role playing and gacha features.
Character leveling, dungeon rewards, gacha statistics and other aspects of the game can be computed and planned.
This project aims at providing such a support through various technologies.

# Objectives

There is two parallel objectives in this project:
- Support a player (including me) in organizing his/her play of Genshin Impact ;
- Train myself by using various technologies.

The first objective drives the content of this project.
We use Genshin Impact-specific concepts and process Genshin Impact-relevant data.
This aspect remains rather open: we start small but we will grow as long as we find useful stuff to add.

The second objective drives the form of the project, split in 3 modules:
- a Java library, aimed at Java developers (like me), which provides all the data and computational aspects ;
- a REST web service, aimed at other developers, which exposes the features of the library online through a REST API ;
- a website, aimed at human users, which provides a simple yet nice interface to consume the web service.

Just to be clear: everything could be implemented as a website.
We won't do that here, because it would focus the experience on few web technologies.
That would dramatically reduce the experience gained as a whole.
And since I am a Java developer, If I had to choose, I would prefer to reduce everything to the Java library.
Surely, that would not be enough for other people (especially non developers) to use it.

So both objectives are equally important.

Finally, this project is open source (CC0).
If you have any idea or need, any relevant addition is welcome.
Just be aware that I am the owner of the repository, so I will have the last word.
I am however completely fine if you want to fork this project to make it your own and adapt it as you wish.
